# Files for research project in fair division
## Done as part of final project in CS

> We implemented algorithm for fair division from the article “An Improved Approximation Algorithm for Maximin Shares” by Jugal Garg and Setareh Taki, into an open-source library in Python named Fairpy. 
> 
 > [OUR IMLEMENTATION](https://github.com/erelsgl/fairpy/blob/master/fairpy/items/approximation_maximin_share.py)
 > 
 > The files were done as part of the project.
 

## Files
 - Summary of the algorithms in a Hebrew article and examples of how the algorithms work.
 - Comparison the performance of the algorithm to other algorithms for fair division in hebrew.
 - Poster explaining the project
 - The concluding article
the concentrating conclusions to an article.
